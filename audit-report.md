# Feature Audit Report for Swipe and Match Functionality

Below is a detailed audit of the implementation of four key features in the app related to candidate fetching, swipe batching, match detection, and rate limiting. Each part examines the app code and Supabase backend to verify correctness, efficiency, and synchronization.

## Part 1: Efficient Candidate Fetching and Caching

**Requirements:**
- Fetch a batch of candidate profiles (20â€“30 at a time), excluding users already swiped on or matched with.
- Cache batches locally for smooth swiping.
- Query should randomize order and support filters (location, industry, tier).
- Supabase function (e.g., `get_swipe_candidates`) to implement this logic.
- Prefetch next batch as user nears the end of the current batch.

**Findings:**
- **Presence and Implementation:** This feature is implemented in the app and backend.
  - In `store/matches-store.ts`, the `fetchPotentialMatches` and `prefetchNextBatch` functions fetch batches of 25 profiles (`batchSize: 25`), excluding swiped/matched users via Supabase queries or mock data filters.
  - Local caching is handled with `potentialMatches` and `cachedMatches` arrays in the store, ensuring smooth swiping.
  - Prefetching is triggered when the current batch is low (`prefetchThreshold: 5`), as seen in `app/(tabs)/discover.tsx` useEffect hook.
  - In Supabase `schema.sql`, the `find_users_within_distance` function fetches candidates, excluding swiped/matched users and supporting location-based filtering with a `max_distance` parameter and `global_search` option based on tier.
- **Logic and Efficiency:** The logic is mostly correct and efficient.
  - Randomization is implemented via `sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5)` in the app, which is not truly random for large datasets and could be improved.
  - Location filtering is supported, but industry or tier-based filters are not fully implemented in the app or backend query.
  - Fetching 25 profiles at a time is reasonable, though performance could degrade with very large user bases if not optimized further in Supabase with indexing or pagination.
- **Missing Pieces or Bugs:**
  - No advanced filters (e.g., industry, business stage) in the fetch logic or UI, despite being a requirement.
  - The randomization method is suboptimal and may lead to biased ordering.
- **App and Backend Sync:** The app and backend are in sync.
  - The app calls the `find_users_within_distance` RPC with correct parameters (`user_id`, `max_distance`, `global_search`).
  - Return types match, with Supabase returning user data that is converted to `UserProfile` type in the app via `supabaseToUserProfile`.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Implement advanced filters (industry, tier) in both app UI and Supabase function to allow more targeted candidate selection.
  - Replace the current randomization with a more robust method, possibly using a database-level `ORDER BY RANDOM()` in Supabase for better performance.
  - Ensure proper indexing on `likes` and `matches` tables in Supabase to optimize exclusion queries.

## Part 2: Batched Swipe Recording and Match Creation

**Requirements:**
- Queue swipe actions locally and send in batches (e.g., every 5 swipes or few seconds).
- Use a single RPC call to record a batch of swipes.
- Supabase function (e.g., `record_swipes`) records swipes in a transaction and creates matches for reciprocal right swipes, returning new matches.

**Findings:**
- **Presence and Implementation:** This feature is fully implemented.
  - In `store/matches-store.ts`, `queueSwipe` adds swipes to a local `swipeQueue`, and `processSwipeBatch` sends them in batches when the queue reaches 5 swipes or via a periodic interval (every 3 seconds, set in `batchProcessingInterval`).
  - The app uses a single RPC call `process_batch_swipes` via `processBatchSwipes` in `lib/supabase.ts` to send the batch.
  - In Supabase `schema.sql`, `process_batch_swipes` function processes swipes in a loop, records them in the `likes` table, checks for reciprocal likes to create matches in the `matches` table, and returns new match details.
- **Logic and Efficiency:** The logic is correct, with room for optimization.
  - Batching reduces network calls, and processing in a transaction ensures data consistency.
  - The batch size (5) and interval (3 seconds) might need tuning based on user behavior to balance responsiveness and server load.
  - Error handling in `processSwipeBatch` catches issues but doesn't retry failed batches, which could lead to data loss.
- **Missing Pieces or Bugs:**
  - No retry mechanism for failed batch submissions, which could result in lost swipes if the network fails.
  - No explicit transaction rollback handling in the app if partial batch processing occurs (though Supabase handles this internally).
- **App and Backend Sync:** The app and backend are synchronized.
  - The app sends swipes as an array of `SwipeAction` objects to `process_batch_swipes` with correct parameters.
  - The backend returns new matches with fields (`match_id`, `user_id`, `matched_user_id`, `created_at`) that are mapped to the `Match` type in the app.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Implement a retry mechanism in `processSwipeBatch` for failed network requests to ensure no swipes are lost.
  - Consider configurable batch sizes or intervals based on network conditions or user activity.
  - Add logging for failed batches to monitor and debug issues in production.

## Part 3: Real-Time Match Detection and Notification

**Requirements:**
- Process response for new matches after batch submission.
- Update UI in real-time for new matches and trigger notifications.
- Supabase function returns all new matches, and app handles them appropriately.

**Findings:**
- **Presence and Implementation:** This feature is implemented for UI updates but lacks full notification support.
  - In `store/matches-store.ts`, `processSwipeBatch` updates the `matches` state and sets `newMatch` when matches are created from a batch.
  - In `app/(tabs)/discover.tsx`, a useEffect hook detects `newMatch` and displays a modal with match details, providing real-time UI feedback.
  - Haptics feedback is triggered on match detection (for non-web platforms).
  - Supabase `process_batch_swipes` function returns new matches as a table result with match details.
  - Push notifications or in-app messaging beyond the modal are not implemented.
- **Logic and Efficiency:** The logic for UI updates is correct and efficient.
  - Using state updates and useEffect for real-time feedback is appropriate and responsive.
  - Fetching matched user data from AsyncStorage for the modal is a temporary workaround and not ideal for scalability.
- **Missing Pieces or Bugs:**
  - Push notifications for new matches are not implemented, which is a missing feature for user engagement.
  - Reliance on AsyncStorage for matched user data could fail if data is outdated or unavailable; a direct API call would be better.
- **App and Backend Sync:** The app and backend are in sync.
  - Supabase returns new match data that is correctly processed in the app to update state and UI.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Implement push notifications using Expo Notifications or a similar service to alert users of new matches even when the app is in the background.
  - Replace AsyncStorage lookup for matched user data with a direct Supabase query to ensure fresh data in the match modal.
  - Consider debouncing or throttling match notifications if multiple matches occur in quick succession to avoid UI overload.

## Part 4: Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention

**Requirements:**
- App checks swipe/match limits based on user tier before allowing swipes.
- Supabase backend enforces these limits (e.g., via `can_swipe` function).
- App and backend are consistent in limit checking and enforcement.

**Findings:**
- **Presence and Implementation:** This feature is fully implemented in both app and backend.
  - In `store/matches-store.ts`, `checkSwipeLimits` and `syncUsageCounters` functions check daily swipe and match limits before allowing actions, based on tier settings from `useAuthStore`.
  - UI feedback is provided in `app/(tabs)/discover.tsx` with a modal when limits are reached (`swipeLimitReached` or `matchLimitReached`).
  - In Supabase `schema.sql`, `check_user_limits` function returns whether an action (swipe/match) is allowed based on tier limits and current usage, and `process_batch_swipes` respects these limits by stopping processing when limits are hit.
  - Limits are synced periodically via `syncUsageCounters` in the store.
- **Logic and Efficiency:** The logic is correct and reasonably efficient.
  - Checking limits before swipes prevents unnecessary actions, and periodic syncing keeps the app state accurate.
  - The interval for syncing (every 3 seconds with batch processing) might be too frequent or infrequent depending on usage patterns, risking temporary desync.
- **Missing Pieces or Bugs:**
  - No explicit handling for edge cases like clock changes or timezone issues that could affect daily limit resets.
  - If sync fails, the app might use outdated limit data until the next successful sync.
- **App and Backend Sync:** The app and backend are consistent.
  - Tier settings are fetched via `get_user_tier_settings` RPC in `store/auth-store.ts`, and limits are enforced similarly in both app and backend.
  - Both use the same logic for daily limits based on timestamps.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Add handling for timezone or clock change issues in daily limit calculations to ensure accurate resets.
  - Implement a fallback or more robust error handling for sync failures to prevent actions based on stale data.
  - Consider adjusting the sync interval dynamically based on user activity or app state (e.g., more frequent when near limits).

## Summary
All four features are implemented with a high degree of correctness and synchronization between the app and Supabase backend. Key strengths include batch processing for efficiency, real-time UI updates for matches, and consistent limit enforcement. Areas for improvement include missing push notifications, lack of advanced filters for candidate fetching, suboptimal randomization, and potential desync in limit checking. Recommendations focus on enhancing user experience (notifications, filters), improving robustness (retries, error handling), and optimizing performance (randomization, sync intervals).
