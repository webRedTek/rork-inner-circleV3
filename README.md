## Note on Git Initialization

Unfortunately, Git operations such as `git init` are not available in this environment. If you need assistance with initializing a Git repository, you'll need to perform this action outside of this platform.

If you have any other requests or need help with further development, optimization, or bug fixes in your React Native app, I'm ready to assist. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.
