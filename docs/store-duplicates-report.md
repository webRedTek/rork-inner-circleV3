# Store Duplicates Analysis Report
Last Updated: 2024-12-20

This report identifies duplicate functionality across the stores in the icV3 application and provides recommendations for consolidation.

## 1. Error Handling Duplicates
- **Current Implementation**:
  - handleApiError in notification-store.ts
  - handleError in error-utils.ts
  - Multiple stores have their own error handling logic
- **Recommendation**: Consolidate all error handling in error-utils.ts

## 2. Cache Management Duplicates
- **Current Implementation**:
  - ProfileCache class in matches-store.ts
  - Cache management in usage-store.ts (defaultUsageCache)
  - Cache clearing in auth-store.ts
- **Recommendation**: Create a unified caching system

## 3. Batch Processing Duplicates
- **Current Implementation**:
  - processSwipeBatch in matches-store.ts
  - queueBatchUpdate in usage-store.ts
  - Both implement similar batch processing logic
- **Recommendation**: Create a generic batch processor

## 4. State Validation Duplicates
- **Current Implementation**:
  - validateState in matches-store.ts
  - Similar validation logic in auth-store.ts
- **Recommendation**: Create a shared state validation utility

## 5. Retry Logic Duplicates
- **Current Implementation**:
  - withRateLimitAndRetry in matches-store.ts
  - withRetry in error-utils.ts
  - defaultRetryStrategy in usage-store.ts
- **Recommendation**: Use only error-utils.ts implementation

## 6. Network Status Checking
- **Current Implementation**:
  - checkNetworkConnection in auth-store.ts
  - Network checks in matches-store.ts
- **Recommendation**: Move to a dedicated network utility

## 7. Initialization Logic Duplicates
- **Current Implementation**:
  - Each store has its own initialization logic
  - Similar patterns in auth-store.ts, matches-store.ts, usage-store.ts
- **Recommendation**: Create a store initialization orchestrator

## 8. Cleanup Logic Duplicates
- **Current Implementation**:
  - stopBatchProcessing in matches-store.ts
  - stopUsageSync in usage-store.ts
  - Similar cleanup patterns
- **Recommendation**: Standardize cleanup approach

## 9. Default Profile Creation
- **Current Implementation**:
  - createDefaultProfile in auth-store.ts
  - Similar profile initialization in matches-store.ts
- **Recommendation**: Move to a shared user utility

## 10. Rate Limiting Logic
- **Current Implementation**:
  - Rate limiting in matches-store.ts
  - Rate limits in usage-store.ts
- **Recommendation**: Create a shared rate limiter

## 11. Notification Handling
- **Current Implementation**:
  - Multiple stores call notification functions directly
  - Some have their own notification logic
- **Recommendation**: Use only notification-store.ts

## 12. Session Management
- **Current Implementation**:
  - Session checks scattered across stores
  - Authentication state checking duplicated
- **Recommendation**: Centralize in auth-store.ts

## Next Steps
1. Prioritize consolidation based on:
   - Risk of bugs due to inconsistent implementations
   - Maintenance burden
   - Impact on performance
   - Ease of refactoring

2. Consider creating these new utilities:
   - Generic cache manager
   - Batch processing utility
   - State validation helper
   - Network status manager
   - Store initialization orchestrator
   - Shared rate limiter

3. Update documentation to reflect:
   - Single source of truth for each functionality
   - Clear ownership of utilities
   - Dependencies between stores
   - Initialization order

4. Testing considerations:
   - Add tests for consolidated utilities
   - Ensure backward compatibility
   - Verify no regression in existing functionality
   - Add performance benchmarks

## Impact Analysis
Consolidating these duplicates would:
- Reduce codebase size
- Improve maintainability
- Ensure consistent behavior
- Make testing more straightforward
- Reduce potential for bugs
- Improve performance through shared caching
- Make the codebase easier to understand

## Migration Strategy
1. Create new utilities one at a time
2. Gradually migrate stores to use new utilities
3. Add comprehensive tests
4. Remove old implementations
5. Update documentation
6. Monitor for any issues

## Notes
- Keep this document updated as changes are made
- Use it as a reference for future development
- Consider it a living document that evolves with the codebase
